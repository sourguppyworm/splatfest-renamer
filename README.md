Splatfest renamer 1.3 - by sourguppyworm

Renames images for Splatoon 3 Splatfest categories for usage on Inkipedia, and can output file templates and gallery captions.

As a disclaimer: This is my first program, so it is built sort of badly and I know that. It works just fine most of the time though

## Requirements:
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3</a> - Added to PATH during installation

I have only tested this program on Windows. I cannot guarantee that it will work on another operating system.

## Usage:
Open the script and follow the instructions given on the terminal.

Enter 0 to skip a particular image.

## Currently supported categories:
- Splatfest Tees
- Sprinklers of Doom
- Idols (day 1 and 2, deep cut and squid sisters)
- Jellyfish (one of each type per team)

## Known issues:
- Invalid filenames sometimes skip input instead of reprompting
- Attempting to rename a file the same thing it is already named will force you to cancel to proceed or the program will crash

## Bug reports:
@sourguppyworm on discord - be prepared to work with me and troubleshoot if i cannot reproduce the issue on my end
